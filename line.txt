What are the four basic types of web hosting?


There are four basic types of web hosting: shared hosting, VPS hosting, dedicated hosting, and cloud hosting.

Shared hosting is the most basic type of hosting. It is where your website shares server resources with other websites. This is the cheapest type of hosting, but it also has the least amount of resources and is not as reliable as the other types of hosting.

VPS hosting is a step up from shared hosting. It is where your website shares server resources with other websites, but you have your own virtual server that is isolated from the other websites on the server. This type of hosting is more reliable than shared hosting and has more resources, but it is also more expensive.

Dedicated hosting is the most reliable type of hosting. It is where your website has its own server that is solely dedicated to your website. This type of hosting is the most expensive, but it also has the most resources and is the most reliable.

Cloud hosting is a newer type of hosting that combines the best features of shared hosting, VPS hosting, and dedicated hosting. It is where your website shares server resources with other websites, but you have your own virtual server that is isolated from the other websites on the server. This type of hosting is more reliable than shared hosting and has more resources, but it is also more expensive.
