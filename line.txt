Another essential new approach to SEO in the 2020s is by identifying the value of the Keyword you wish to rank for versus the search volume of the keyword. If a keyword is valuable to your business but has less search volume, it's just as valuable as one with massive search volume, or even more.


You can identify the value of a keyword by its commercial intent. A keyword with high commercial intent is a keyword that someone is more likely to type into a search engine when they're looking to buy something. These are the types of keywords you want to target because they have the potential to bring in more revenue for your business.

Some keywords have high commercial intent but low search volume, while others have low commercial intent but high search volume. It's important to identify which keywords are valuable to your business and target those keywords.

By targeting valuable, high commercial intent keywords, you'll be able to rank for keywords that have the potential to bring in more revenue for your business.
