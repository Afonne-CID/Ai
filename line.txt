MailChimp Cons

MailChimp pricing plans can be expensive for small businesses, with the most basic plan starting at $10/month. If you have a small list of subscribers, you may be better off using a free plan or another email marketing service.

2. It can be difficult to use

MailChimp can be difficult to use, especially for beginners. The user interface is not always intuitive, and there are a lot of features that can be confusing.

3. It can be unreliable

MailChimp has been known to be unreliable, with outages and other issues occurring occasionally. This can be frustrating for users, especially if their email campaigns are time-sensitive.

4. It's not always the best choice for large businesses

MailChimp is not always the best choice for large businesses. The pricing plans are not as affordable as some of the other email marketing services, and the features may not be as comprehensive.
