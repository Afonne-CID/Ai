What Is Domain Authority


Domain Authority (DA) is a search engine ranking metric that is used to measure the authority of a website. Introduced by Moz, Domain Authority is a score (on a 100-point scale) that predicts how well a website will rank on search engines.

Domain Authority is determined by evaluating a website’s inbound links. The more high-quality links a website has, the higher its Domain Authority score will be.

Domain Authority is important for SEO because it is one of the factors that search engines use to rank websites. A high Domain Authority score means that a website is likely to rank high in search engine results pages (SERPs), which means that the website will receive more traffic.

Domain Authority is not the only factor that determines a website’s ranking on search engines, but it is one of the most important factors. A website with a high Domain Authority score is more likely to rank higher than a website with a low Domain Authority score.
