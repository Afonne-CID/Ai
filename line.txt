Ad Network: What Is Propel Media RPM?


At Propel Media, we are experts in programmatic media buying. We are a self-service platform that allows buyers to purchase ad space on premium websites through real-time bidding. This allows us to offer our clients the best possible rates and reach.

One of the most important metrics we use to measure the success of our campaigns is RPM, or revenue per thousand impressions. This metric measures how much revenue we generate for each 1,000 impressions our ads receive. It is important to note that RPM is not the same as CPM, or cost per thousand impressions.

CPM measures how much it costs to generate 1,000 impressions, while RPM measures how much revenue is generated. This is an important distinction, as it is possible for a campaign to have a low CPM but a high RPM.

This is because CPM measures the cost of reaching 1,000 people, while RPM measures the revenue generated from those 1,000 people.
