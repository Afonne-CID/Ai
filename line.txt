Salesforce Marketing Cloud's cross-channel marketing
 capabilities provide the ability to orchestrate campaigns across email, social media, mobile, and the web.

Salesforce Marketing Cloud is the only marketing platform that offers an intuitive interface to create and manage campaigns across all channels, and provides an integrated view of customer interactions across channels. This allows you to orchestrate campaigns across email, social media, mobile, and the web.

You can use Salesforce Marketing Cloud to create and send targeted email campaigns, including dynamic content that changes based on customer interactions and profile data. You can also create and publish social media posts, ads, and landing pages, and track how customers interact with your content across channels. And with Salesforce Marketing Cloud's mobile SDK, you can create mobile apps that allow customers to interact with your brand on the go.
