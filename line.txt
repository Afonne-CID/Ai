TrafficForce represents a good proposition for sites who attract healthy numbers of visitors and know the business of selling traffic. The platform has self-serve technology which empowers the publishers that use it as well as features like offer back URLs for any traffic that goes unsold. Rates of CPM on the network are good for tier-1 countries, but it’s not all good news. Sites have to earn at least $100 to be entitled to a payment, making it less-suited to smaller groups, while there is no referral program for publishers to maximize their revenue. Support is available via email, Skype, instant message and over the phone, although getting a response on some of these channels can sometimes take a while. Added to the case against small sites is the network’s focus on quality traffic, which can result in low fill rates and inferior earnings than on some of TrafficForce’s competitors. That said, for any publisher earning good amounts via online advertising, TrafficForce is ready to offer a self-serve platform which ticks some very important boxes.


TrafficForce is a traffic exchange network that connects buyers and sellers of traffic. It has been operational since 2007 and boasts a large user base of over 1.5 million members. The network offers a self-serve technology which allows publishers to buy and sell traffic without the need for a middleman. TrafficForce also offers offer back URLs, which allows publishers to track the effectiveness of their traffic campaigns. In addition, the network has a good rate of CPM for tier-1 countries. However, the network requires that publishers earn at least $100 before they are entitled to a payment, which may be a hindrance to smaller sites. The network also has a focus on quality traffic, which may result in low fill rates and inferior earnings.
