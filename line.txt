RPM, or revenue per thousand impressions, is a metric used to measure how much revenue an ad network or publisher generates per thousand impressions. This metric is also known as CPM, or cost per thousand impressions.

To calculate RPM, divide the network's or publisher's revenue by the number of impressions served. For example, if a network generates $10,000 in revenue from 100,000 impressions served, the network's RPM is $100 (10,000/100,000).

RPM can be used to measure the effectiveness of an ad campaign. If an advertiser's goal is to generate a certain amount of revenue, they can use RPM to determine how many impressions they need to purchase to reach that goal.
