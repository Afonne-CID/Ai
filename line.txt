SmartyAds offers various types of ad units and all of them are high paying. The CPM rates for SmartyAds vary depending on the country, ad format, and category, but they are always higher than the rates from other ad networks.

For example, the average CPM rate for SmartyAds in the United States is $5. However, in some cases it can be as high as $50. The CPM rates for other ad networks are usually much lower, about $1-2. So, if you place SmartyAds on your website, you can make 5-10 times more money than you would with other ad networks.
