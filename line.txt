The RPM for publishers on the Popads network varies. On an average, publishers can expect CPM rates from $0.60 to $3.00 per thousand impressions for worldwide traffic.


However, the RPM can vary depending on a number of factors, such as the country or region of the traffic, the quality of the traffic, the ad format, and the competition for ad inventory on the network.

Generally speaking, the RPM is higher for traffic from developed countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. The RPM is also higher for traffic that engages with the ads, such as clicking on the ads or watching the videos.
