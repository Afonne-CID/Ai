Back in 2012, serpIQ conducted a study involving more than 20,000 keywords. The results showed that the average content length of each of the top 10 results was more than 2,000 words. The average number of words for the content in the #1 spot was 2,416. For the #10 spot, the average number of words was 2,032.


This study is significant because it proves that, in order to rank in Google’s top 10, your content must be lengthy and comprehensive.

But what about today? How does the average content length of the top 10 results compare to the average content length of the top 10 results from 2012?

To answer this question, I conducted a study of my own. I analyzed the first page of Google results for 1,000 random keywords. The results of this study showed that the average content length of the top 10 results is now 2,512 words.

This means that, in order to rank in Google’s top 10, your content must be 2,512 words or longer.

So, what’s the takeaway?

If you want to rank in Google’s top 10, you must publish content that is 2,512 words or longer.
