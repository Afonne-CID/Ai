Jasper.ai writing software overview


Jasper.ai is a startup that is developing artificial intelligence (AI) software that can improve a person's writing skills. The software uses a person's own writing style to provide feedback and suggestions on how to improve their writing. The software is currently in private beta and is only available to a limited number of people.

Jasper.ai was founded in 2016 by CEO Andrew Ng, a Stanford professor and former head of Google Brain, and CTO Daphne Koller, a Stanford professor and co-founder of Coursera. The company is based in San Francisco, California.

The software is designed to help people with different writing styles, such as those who write in a more formal style or those who write in a more conversational style. The software can also help people who are not native English speakers to improve their writing skills.

The software is based on a neural network that was trained on a large dataset of writing samples. The dataset was annotated with different types of feedback, such as grammar corrections, style suggestions, and vocabulary suggestions.

The software is designed to provide real-time feedback as you are writing. The feedback is displayed in a separate window, and you can choose to accept or ignore the suggestions.

The software is currently available as a web app and a Google Chrome extension. The company plans to release a desktop app and an iOS app in the future.

Jasper.ai conclusion


We started Jasper.ai because we saw an opportunity to use machine learning (ML) to help software developers be more productive. We’re building the first AI-powered development environment, which we hope will one day serve as the primary way developers interact with their code.

Our initial focus is on providing better code completion suggestions. To do this, we’re using a technique called semantic parsing, which is a way of understanding the meaning of code. We’re also building other features that will help developers write code faster and with fewer errors.

We believe that the future of development will be powered by AI, and we’re excited to be on the forefront of this change.
