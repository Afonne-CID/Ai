TrafficForce's Ad Network Cons for Publishers


There are a few things to consider when working with TrafficForce's ad network as a publisher. The first thing to consider is that there is a minimum traffic requirement of 10,000 monthly pageviews. If you do not have the required traffic, you will not be able to use the network.

Another thing to consider is the types of ads that are available. TrafficForce offers a variety of ad types, but the majority of them are standard display ads. If you are looking for something more specific, such as pop-unders or interstitials, you may be disappointed.

Additionally, TrafficForce's fill rate is not always 100%. This means that not all of the ads shown will be from TrafficForce; some may be from other ad networks. If you are looking for a higher fill rate, TrafficForce may not be the best option.

Finally, it is important to note that TrafficForce takes a commission on all sales generated through its network. This commission ranges from 20% to 50%, so you will want to keep that in mind when setting your prices.
