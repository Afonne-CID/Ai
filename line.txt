What Is Podcast or podcasting?


Podcasting is a method of distributing audio content over the Internet, using syndication feeds, for playback on portable audio players and computers. The term "podcasting" is a neologism derived from the words "iPod" and "broadcasting". The word was coined by Ben Hammersley, a British journalist, in an article for The Guardian newspaper in 2004.

Podcasting is a form of webcasting and can be used to create audio shows, radio programs, or educational materials. Shows can be either audio-only or include video as well. They are distributed using syndication feeds, and can be automatically downloaded and played on portable audio players and computers.

Podcasting is a great way to share your thoughts and ideas with the world. It's also a great way to learn new things, listen to interesting stories, and keep up with the latest news.
