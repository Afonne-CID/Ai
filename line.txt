 and Cons of a Standing Desk

There are a lot of debates about the pros and cons of sitting all day at work versus standing all day at work. Some people swear by the standing desk and others prefer to stick with good ol’ fashion sitting. Here at Keap, we’re all about what works best for you and your business, so we’ve compiled a list of the pros and cons of standing desks to help you make the best decision for your team.

Pros of Standing Desks

1. Increased energy and alertness – When you stand, your body has to constantly adjust to stay upright, which engages more muscles and results in more energy.

2. Increased calorie burn – Standing burns more calories than sitting, so if weight loss is one of your goals, standing desks can help you accomplish that.

3. Improved mood – Standing desks have been shown to improve moods, likely due to the increased energy and calorie burn.

4. Reduced back pain – Standing all day can actually help reduce back pain, as opposed to sitting all day which can aggravate back pain.

5. Increased productivity – Some studies have shown that standing desks can lead to increased productivity, likely due to the increased energy and alertness.

Cons of Standing Desks

1. Increased risk of neck and back injuries – Although standing desks can help reduce back pain, they can also lead to new injuries if not used correctly
