Propel Media is a self-service ad platform that helps small businesses and entrepreneurs to create, manage, and measure their online advertising campaigns. The company does not provide specific information on its rates and commissions, but past and present users of the platform have said that Propel Media’s CPM rate ranges between $1 and $1.5. This means that if the publisher has around 30,000 visits in a day, he will earn a profit of about $30 to $35 every day.

In addition to its CPM rate, Propel Media also charges a commission of 10% on all sales that are generated through its platform. This commission is deducted from the publisher’s profits, so he actually ends up earning around $27 to $31 per day.

The great thing about Propel Media is that it is a self-service platform. This means that the publisher can create and manage his own campaigns without having to rely on a third party. He can also track the performance of his campaigns in real time, and make changes or optimizations as needed.

Overall, Propel Media is a great platform for small businesses and entrepreneurs who want to advertise their products or services online. The platform’s CPM rate is competitive, and the commission is low enough that the publisher can still make a profit even if his traffic is low.
