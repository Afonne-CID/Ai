ConvertKit Cons


As an email marketing platform, ConvertKit has a lot to offer. It’s easy to use, especially for those who are already familiar with email marketing, and it provides a lot of features and options for subscribers and email marketers alike.

However, ConvertKit also has a few drawbacks. One such drawback is its lack of automation features. Unlike some other email marketing platforms, ConvertKit does not offer any automation features that would allow you to automatically send emails or take other actions based on subscriber behavior.

Another drawback is its relatively high price tag. ConvertKit is not the most expensive email marketing platform out there, but it is more expensive than some of its competitors.

Finally, ConvertKit is still relatively new, and as such, it may not have all the features and options that more established email marketing platforms have. However, the ConvertKit team is constantly working to improve the platform, so this may not be a drawback for long.
