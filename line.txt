What is SEO?


SEO is an abbreviation for “search engine optimization”. It is the process of improving the ranking of a website on search engines. The higher the ranking, the more likely people are to find the website.

SEO involves optimizing a website for certain keywords. These keywords are then used in the website’s content, as well as in the titles of its pages and in its metatags. SEO also involves improving the website’s link popularity. This is done by getting links from other websites.
