Measuring your guest blogging success: Ranking Keywords


There are a variety of different metrics you can use to measure the success of your guest blogging campaign. One of the most important is to track the ranking of your target keywords.

If you're guest blogging to increase your website's search engine ranking, tracking your keyword ranking is essential. You'll want to make sure that your target keywords are moving up in the search engine results pages (SERPs).

There are a number of different tools you can use to track your keyword ranking, including:

-Google Adwords Keyword Tool
-Google Trends
-SEMrush
-SERPS.com

You can also use the Google search engine to track your ranking. To do this, simply type in your target keyword and scroll to the bottom of the page. There you'll see a graph that shows how your keyword ranking has changed over time.

If you're not sure which keywords to target, you can use Google Adwords Keyword Tool to find popular keywords related to your topic. The tool provides information on how many people are searching for a particular keyword, as well as the average cost-per-click (CPC) for advertising on that keyword.

You can also use Google Trends to measure the popularity of a particular keyword. The tool allows you to see how popular a keyword is over time, as well as the regions where it is most popular.
