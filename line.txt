How does SendGrid work?


SendGrid is a cloud-based email delivery platform. It allows you to send transactional and marketing emails, manage your subscriber list, and track email engagement metrics.

SendGrid's platform consists of two components: the SendGrid infrastructure and the SendGrid application programming interface (API).

The SendGrid infrastructure is a set of servers that handle the email delivery process. When you send an email through SendGrid, it is routed through these servers to the recipient's email server.

The SendGrid API is a set of tools that allow you to programmatically interact with the SendGrid infrastructure. With the API, you can manage your subscriber list, send emails, and track email engagement metrics.
