Ad Network: How does EMX work?



EMX is an ad network that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses a unique algorithm to match ad buyers and sellers, and to ensure that ads are delivered in a timely and efficient manner.

The EMX algorithm is based on a smart contract. This contract contains a list of ad buyers and sellers, as well as the terms and conditions of the ad sale. When a buyer wants to purchase an ad, they send a request to the contract. The contract then automatically selects a seller based on the buyer’s criteria.

The contract then creates a new smart contract between the buyer and the seller. This contract contains the terms of the ad sale, as well as the price and delivery date. The contract is then executed, and the ad is delivered to the buyer.

EMX is a decentralized ad network that uses the Ethereum blockchain to match ad buyers and sellers. It is a more efficient and secure way to buy and sell ads.

Ad Network: What Is EMX RPM?


What does EMX RPM mean?

EMX RPM stands for Enhanced Media Exchange RPM. It is a metric that measures the revenue per 1,000 impressions (RPM) generated by a media company’s advertising network.

EMX RPM is a more accurate measure of a media company’s ad network performance than traditional RPM, which is calculated using gross revenue and total impressions. EMX RPM takes into account the fact that not all impressions are equally valuable. For example, an impression that is served on a high-traffic website is more valuable than an impression that is served on a low-traffic website.

EMX RPM is a more accurate measure of a media company’s ad network performance because it factors in the following:

The website’s traffic The website’s audience The website’s demographics The website’s location The website’s content
