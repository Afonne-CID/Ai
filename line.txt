How do you use benchmark in email?


Benchmarking is a process of comparing the performance of one entity to that of another. In the context of email, it can be used to measure the deliverability of your email campaigns by comparing them to industry benchmarks. This can help you to identify any areas where your campaigns may be underperforming, and make the necessary adjustments to improve your deliverability.

By using benchmarks as a guide, you can ensure that your email marketing is as effective as possible.


How do you create a Benchmark email?


Benchmarking involves creating a "standard" by which you can compare your own results. This can be done in a number of ways, but email marketers can use a variety of metrics to create a benchmark.

To begin, you'll need to decide on a metric to use as your benchmark. This could be anything from open rates to click-through rates (CTRs) to conversion rates. Once you've selected a metric, you'll need to gather data on how your email campaigns perform against this metric.

Next, you'll need to create a "control group" - a group of emails that you send which have a similar design, offer, and target audience as your benchmark group. This will allow you to compare the results of your benchmark group against a "normal" group.

Once you have your data, you can start to see how your campaigns compare to the industry average, and make changes to your campaigns where necessary.

So, how do you create a benchmark email? It's actually quite simple - just follow the steps outlined above!
