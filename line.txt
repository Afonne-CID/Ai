Technical SEO Checklist: Set one of your domain names as canonical


 canonicalization is the process of picking one URL as the "primary" one, and all other duplicate URLs are essentially redirected to that primary URL. This helps search engines understand which version of a page to show in search results, and it can also help consolidate link equity and authority (depending on how you set things up).

There are a few different ways to canonicalize URLs, but the most common is to add a rel="canonical" link tag to the <head> of the page. This tells search engines that the specified URL is the preferred version, and they should treat all other versions as duplicates.

For example, if you have both www.example.com and example.com as live versions of your website, you would canonicalize them like this:

<link rel="canonical" href="http://www.example.com/" />

<link rel="canonical" href="http://example.com/" />

This tells search engines that the www.example.com version is the primary one, and they should show that URL in search results whenever possible.

There are a few other ways to canonicalize URLs, but this is the most common and easiest to set up. If you're not sure how to do it, your web developer should be able to help.


Technical SEO Checklist: Choose an SEO-friendly content management system

3. Site Structure

A good CMS should also allow you to create a well-structured website. This means you should be able to create pages and directories that are easy to navigate, and that help improve your site’s ranking in search results.

4. Search Engine Optimization Settings

Your CMS should also have some built-in SEO settings that you can use to help improve your ranking in search results. These settings can include things like meta data settings, URL structure settings, and htaccess settings.

Bloggers are the new journalists.

Though the term “blogger” is often used to describe anyone who writes a personal online diary, it is also used to describe professional journalists who use the blog format to report the news. The advantage of the blog format is that it is quick and easy to update, and it can include multimedia elements such as photos and videos.

Unlike traditional journalism, which is based on the idea of objectivity, bloggers often express their personal opinions in their blogs. This can be a disadvantage, because it can make it difficult to determine the truthfulness of the information in the blog. However, it can also be an advantage, because it allows the blogger to build a relationship with their readers and provide them with more personal information.

Most bloggers are unpaid, but there are a few high-profile bloggers who are paid to write their blogs. Some bloggers are also hired by companies to write blog posts about their products or services.

Blogging is a relatively new phenomenon, and it is still evolving. As more and more people start blogging, the quality of the information in blogs will continue to improve.

When it comes to SEO, having a strong keyword strategy is essential. By including your top-ranking keywords in your website’s content, you can improve your website’s ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs).
