One of the main goals of guest blogging is to get more backlinks to your website. But how do you know whether your guest blogging efforts are effective in terms of acquiring links?

There are a few different ways to measure the impact of your guest blogging. One way is to look at the number of backlinks your website has acquired as a result of your guest blogging.

To do this, you'll need to use some sort of backlink tool, such as Majestic SEO, Open Site Explorer, or Ahrefs. These tools will allow you to see how many links your website has from different websites.

Once you have this data, you can compare the number of links acquired before and after you started guest blogging. If you see a significant increase in the number of links after you started guest blogging, then you can be confident that your guest blogging is effective in terms of acquiring links.

However, if you're not seeing a significant increase in the number of links, then you may need to rethink your guest blogging strategy.

To measure the effects of your guest blogging, you can use the Ahrefs domain rating tool. This tool measures the quality of a website based on its backlinks, and it can help you determine whether your guest blogging is having a positive or negative impact on your website's SEO rankings.

The Ahrefs domain rating tool is available as a paid subscription, but you can also use the free version of the tool to get a general idea of a website's domain rating.

How To Measure Effects of Your Guest Blogging: Alexa Rank


Guest blogging is a great way to get your content in front of new eyes, and to increase your site's authority in the eyes of search engines. But how can you tell if your guest blogging efforts are actually making a difference?

One way to measure the effects of your guest blogging is to look at your site's Alexa Rank. Alexa Rank is a measure of a site's popularity, based on data from the Alexa web traffic ranking service. The lower a site's Alexa Rank, the more popular it is.

You can use Alexa Rank to compare your site's popularity before and after you start guest blogging. If your Alexa Rank decreases after you start guest blogging, that means your guest blogging efforts are having a positive effect on your site's popularity. If your Alexa Rank increases, on the other hand, your guest blogging efforts are not having the desired effect.

So if you're looking to measure the effects of your guest blogging, Alexa Rank is a good metric to use. Keep in mind, however, that Alexa Rank is just one measure, and it should not be the only factor you consider when evaluating the success of your guest blogging efforts.
