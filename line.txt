The aim is to publish the most complete content you possibly can. Ideally, readers shouldn’t have to read another post on a given topic. Exhaustive content tends to be longer because it's tough to create complete content around a topic while staying under a word count. So in these 20s and the foreseeable future, you need to ignore word counts and pay closer attention to the completeness of the information you provide. If you review top-performing content on your site or somewhere else, you'll discover that top posts adhered to this principle.


You also need to make sure you’re publishing content that is genuinely useful to your audience. That means giving them what they need, not just what you think they need. The days of keyword stuffing and churning out low-quality content are behind us. We now live in a world where Google’s RankBrain algorithm is more important than ever before. If you want your content to rank well, you need to focus on providing value and solving your audience’s problems.

So how can you make sure your content is comprehensive and useful? Here are a few tips:

1. Research your topic inside and out.

Before you start writing, make sure you do your research. Study your topic from every possible angle, and make sure you understand it inside and out. The more comprehensive your content is, the more useful it will be to your audience.

2. Use data and examples to back up your points.

Don’t just rely on your own opinions; use data and examples to back up your points. This will help your content stand out from the crowd and make it more credible.

3. Write in a clear, concise, and easy-to-read style.

Don’t try to cram too much information into your posts. Write in a clear, concise, and easy-to-read style. This will make your content more user-friendly and help it rank better in search engines.

4. Make sure your posts are well-organized and well-written.

Before you publish your content, make sure you proofread it and fix any errors. Also, make sure your posts are well-organized and well-written. This will help make them more readable and engaging.

5. Go the extra mile.

If you want your content to be truly comprehensive, go the extra mile. Write longer posts, include more data and examples, and add videos, infographics, and other multimedia elements. This will help your content stand out from the competition and provide more value to your audience.
