Bloggers are the new journalists.

No, I’m not saying that all bloggers are journalists, or that all journalists are bloggers. I’m saying that the role of the blogger is quickly evolving to fill the shoes of the journalist – and that’s a good thing.

Traditional journalism has taken a beating in recent years. With the rise of social media, the public has more access to information than ever before, and they can get that information from a variety of sources. Increasingly, people are turning to bloggers for their news and information.

Why? Because bloggers are more personal and more interactive. They’re not constrained by the same rules and regulations as traditional journalists, and they can be more creative in their storytelling. They also have a closer relationship with their readers, who can interact with them directly through social media.

As the role of the blogger continues to evolve, we can expect to see more and more bloggers taking on the role of journalist – and that’s a good thing. We need more independent voices in the media, and bloggers are filling that role nicely.


What tools do you need to blog?


The first thing you need is a blog platform. This is the software that will allow you to create and publish your blog posts. There are many different options, but the most popular ones are WordPress and Blogger.

You'll also need a domain name and hosting. A domain name is your website's address (e.g. www.example.com) and hosting is the service that stores your website's files so that people can access them online. Hosting can be provided by a variety of companies, such as GoDaddy, Bluehost, and SiteGround.

Once you have a domain name and hosting, you need to set up your blog. This involves creating an account with your chosen blog platform, and then following the instructions to set up your blog.

Once your blog is set up, you can start publishing posts. To create a post, you'll need to write your content, choose a title, and add some tags. You can also add images and videos, and format your text using HTML or Markdown.

When you're ready to publish your post, click the "Publish" button. Your post will then be live on your blog.
