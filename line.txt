shopify seo vs wordpress


There is a lot of debate in the eCommerce world about which platform is better for SEO, Shopify or WordPress. The answer to this question is not as clear-cut as some people might think. Both platforms have their pros and cons, and which one is right for you depends on your specific needs and goals.

Shopify is a hosted platform, meaning that all of the technical aspects of setting up and running your store are taken care of by Shopify. This can be a huge time-saver, especially if you’re not very tech-savvy. Shopify also has a wide range of features and templates that make it easy to create a professional-looking store.

However, because Shopify is a hosted platform, you are limited in terms of the customization you can do. If you need to make changes to the core code of your store, you will need to hire a developer, which can be expensive. Additionally, Shopify is a bit more expensive than WordPress.

WordPress is a self-hosted platform, which means you need to set up and manage your own server. This can be a bit more complicated and time-consuming, but it also gives you more flexibility to customize your store however you want. WordPress is also free to use, although you will need to pay for hosting and a domain name.
