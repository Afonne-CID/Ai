What Is SmartyAds RPM?


SmartyAds RPM is a real-time bidding ad exchange that allows publishers to sell their ad inventory programmatically and advertisers to buy ad space on a per-impression basis. RPM is an acronym for "rate per 1,000 impressions," which is how it calculates ad prices.

SmartyAds RPM is different from other ad exchanges in that it offers both programmatic and direct buying options. Programmatic buying allows advertisers to purchase ad space through a bidding process that takes place automatically, while direct buying allows them to purchase ad space directly from the publisher.

SmartyAds RPM is also unique in that it offers both display and video advertising. Display advertising encompasses all types of online ads that are not video ads, while video advertising refers to ads that are played in a video player, such as YouTube.

Since SmartyAds RPM is a real-time bidding ad exchange, ad prices are constantly changing based on the amount of ad inventory that is available
