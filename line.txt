Is putting podcast on Spotify free?


The answer to this question is a little complicated. Officially, Spotify offers a freemium service, which means that users can listen to a limited number of songs for free and then upgrade to a premium subscription to unlock more features. However, the company has been known to place restrictions on the number of times a song can be played for free before the listener is prompted to upgrade to a premium subscription. So, in short, it depends on the particular song and how often it is played.


Can anyone post a podcast on Spotify?


Spotify is a music streaming service that allows users to listen to music on demand. It offers a library of over 30 million songs, and users can create and share playlists, as well as follow other users to see what music they are listening to.

While Spotify does not allow users to post their own podcasts, there are a number of other ways to share your podcast with listeners. One option is to create a podcast RSS feed and submit it to iTunes, which will make it available to listeners on Apple devices. You can also submit your podcast to other directories, such as Stitcher and TuneIn.

If you want to share your podcast with listeners who are not using Apple devices or do not have access to iTunes, you can embed a player on your website that will allow them to listen to the podcast directly on your website. You can also use a service like SoundCloud to host your podcast and share it with listeners.
