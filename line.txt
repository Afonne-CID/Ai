Analize Domain Metrics Before Pitching A Guest Post: MozBar


Domain metrics are an important factor to consider when pitching a guest post. 
MozBar is a free Chrome extension that allows you to view a website's Domain Authority (DA), Page Authority (PA), and link metrics.

The DA and PA scores give you an idea of how well a website is performing on a scale of 1-100. A higher score means that the website is likely to be more authoritative and have a higher rank in search engine results pages (SERPs).

The link metrics show you the number of links a website has and the quality of those links. A higher number of links and a higher MozRank means that the website is more influential.

You can use MozBar to research the domain metrics of websites you would like to pitch a guest post to. This will help you determine whether or not the website is a good fit for your pitch.

If the website has a high DA and PA score, and a high MozRank, then it is likely that the website is authoritative and influential. In this case, you may want to consider pitching a guest post to the website.

If the website has a low DA and PA score, or a low MozRank, then it is likely that the website is not as authoritative or influential. In this case, you may want to consider pitching a guest post to a different website.
