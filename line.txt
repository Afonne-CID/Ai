Content is a key factor in SEO and is one of the most important drivers of organic search traffic. Content must be well written, keyword rich, and interesting to your audience in order to rank high in search engine results pages (SERPs).

Google judges the quality of content by a variety of factors, including the following:

– The relevance of the content to the user’s search query

– The quality of the content

– The number of external links to the content

– The number of social shares the content receives

Relevance

The relevance of the content to the user’s search query is a key factor in determining the quality of the content. Content that is relevant to the user’s search will rank higher in the SERPs than content that is not relevant.

Quality

The quality of the content is also a key factor in determining its ranking in the SERPs. Google looks at a variety of factors to determine the quality of the content, including the following:

– The length of the content

– The number of images and videos in the content

– The number of external links to the content

– The number of social shares the content receives

External Links

The number of external links to the content is also a factor in determining the quality of the content. Google looks at the number of external links as an indication of the popularity of the content. The more external links the content has, the higher it will rank in the SERPs.

Social Shares

The number of social shares the content receives is also a factor in determining the quality of the content. Google looks at the number of social shares as an indication of the popularity of the content. The more social shares the content has, the higher it will rank in the SERPs.


Content as an SEO ranking factor: Content Quantity


Content quality has long been a ranking factor for Google. But in the past year, the search engine giant has made it clear that content quantity is also a key ranking signal.

In a blog post on the Google Webmaster Central Blog, Google’s Matt Cutts explained that, “One of the things we’ve been doing over the past few months is trying to figure out whether there are any signals that correlate with high-quality sites. And one of the things we’ve found is that sites with a lot of content tend to rank better than sites with less content.”

This is because, as Cutts says, “having more content usually means that you have more opportunities to rank for different queries, and it also usually means that you have more content to send users to.”

So, how can you make sure your site has enough content?

1. Publish new content on a regular basis.

One of the best ways to ensure that you have enough content is to publish new content on a regular basis. This could mean publishing new blog posts, articles, white papers, infographics, or any other type of content.

2. Make use of social media.

Another great way to get your content in front of more people is to make use of social media. Share your content on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, and any other social networks that you use.

3. Syndicate your content.

If you have a blog, you can syndicate your content on other websites. This will help you get your content in front of more people, and it will also help you get links back to your site.

4. Repurpose your content.

If you have a lot of content, you can repurpose it into different formats. For example, you could turn a blog post into an infographic, or you could turn a video into a blog post.

5. Use other people’s content.

If you don’t have time to create your own content, you can use other people’s content. There are a number of ways to do this, including curating content, republishing content, and quoting other people in your content.

Content as an SEO ranking factor: Content Depth and Context


Google has long been focused on delivering quality content to searchers. In recent years, they’ve made increasing emphasis on the quality and relevance of content as a ranking factor. This has led to a renewed focus on content depth and context.

Content depth is a measure of how much information is included on a given topic. Pages with more information are considered to have greater depth. Context is a measure of how well the information on a page relates to the search query. Pages with better contextual information are considered to be more relevant to the query.

Google is increasingly using content depth and context as ranking factors. This is because they believe that pages that provide more in-depth information are more likely to be of high quality and relevant to the searcher. Pages that are more relevant to the query are more likely to be ranked higher in the search results.

There are a number of ways to improve the depth and context of your content. Some of the most effective methods include:

Adding more detail to your pages

Including supplemental content such as images, videos, and infographics

Creating longer articles

Using keyword research to identify related keywords and include them in your content

Writing in a clear, concise, and easy-to-read style

Using strong headlines and subheadings to break up your content

Targeting a specific audience with your content

Providing a clear call to action

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to improving the depth and context of your content. However, by using the methods above, you can create content that is more likely to rank high in the search results.
