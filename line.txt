As of April 21st, 2015, Google has started to use mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal for mobile search results. This means that if your website is not mobile-friendly, it will likely rank lower in mobile search results than websites that are mobile-friendly.

This change was not surprising, as Google has been hinting at it for a while. In February of 2014, Google released a statement saying, “When it comes to search on mobile devices, users should get the most relevant and timely results, no matter where they are.” And in November of 2014, they released an article on their Webmaster Central blog called “Make your site mobile-friendly.”

So what does this mean for your website? If your website is not mobile-friendly, you need to make some changes.

SEO ranking factors: Secure Website (HTTPS and SSL)


Google has been gradually increasing the importance of website security in its search engine ranking algorithm. In January 2014, Google announced that it would give a small ranking boost to websites that use HTTPS encryption. In August 2016, Google announced that it would give a much bigger ranking boost to websites that use HTTPS encryption, and that it would eventually make HTTPS encryption a requirement for all websites.

HTTPS encryption is a process that protects the privacy and security of website visitors by encrypting their communications with the website. This makes it difficult for anyone to eavesdrop on or tamper with the communications.

Google’s goal is to make the internet a more secure place for everyone. By giving a ranking boost to websites that use HTTPS encryption, Google is encouraging website owners to make the switch to HTTPS.

The benefits of HTTPS encryption are not just limited to website visitors. HTTPS encryption can also help protect website owners from being hacked. In July 2016, a group of researchers discovered a security flaw in the HTTPS encryption protocol that could allow hackers to steal data from websites.

If you want your website to rank higher in Google search results, you should consider switching to HTTPS encryption. Google has made it clear that HTTPS encryption is a ranking factor that it is going to increase in importance over time.
