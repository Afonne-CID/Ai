Once you are sure you have a valuable and comprehensive content on a given topic, now your page performance can mean retained users or a high bounce rate page. To complete the full circle of SEO, your on-site and off-site needs to be in place, and page performance is one of the core aspects you can ignore.


There are three types of page performance you need to look into:

1. Page Speed

2. Webpage Content

3. Page Layout

Page Speed

Page speed is how quickly a page loads. You can use PageSpeed Insights to check the page speed of your website. You want your website to have a page speed of 90 or above.

Webpage Content

Make sure your website has valuable and comprehensive content on a given topic. You can use the Yoast SEO plugin to check the word count and readability of your website. The Yoast SEO plugin also checks for the use of keywords and other SEO factors.

Page Layout

Make sure your website has a clean and user-friendly layout. You can use the Google PageSpeed Insights tool to check the page layout of your website.
