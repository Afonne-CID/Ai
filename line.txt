What Is Mediavine RPM?


Mediavine RPM, or Revenue Per Mille, is a way to measure how much money a website is making per 1,000 views. This metric is used to compare different ad networks and determine which one is the most profitable for a website.

To calculate Mediavine RPM, you first need to know your website's total number of views and your total ad revenue. Then, you divide your ad revenue by your total number of views to get your RPM.

For example, if your website had 1,000,000 views and you made $10,000 in ad revenue, your Mediavine RPM would be $10.00. This means that for every 1,000 views your website receives, you make $10 in ad revenue.

Mediavine is one of many ad networks that use RPM to measure profitability. Other ad networks that use RPM include Google AdSense, AdX, and AppNexus. However, Mediavine is the only ad network that pays
