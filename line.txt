What Is Vibrant Media's CPM?


CPM is an acronym for "cost per thousand," which is a term used in online advertising to indicate the price of 1,000 ad impressions. In other words, CPM is the price you pay for every 1,000 ad views on your website or app.

Vibrant Media is a global media company that specializes in digital advertising. We offer a variety of ad products that can be purchased on a CPM basis, including our flagship Vibrant Video product. Our Vibrant Video product is a pre-roll video ad that appears before other videos on publisher websites.

The CPM for our Vibrant Video product varies depending on the country and publisher, but typically falls within the range of $10-30. However, we also offer discounts for volume purchases, so the more you buy, the lower the CPM.
