SendPulse Artificial Intelligence technology (AI)


The term “artificial intelligence” was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy, one of the founders of the field of AI research. McCarthy defines AI as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.” AI research deals with the question of how to create computers that are capable of intelligent behaviour.

In practical terms, AI applications can be deployed in a number of ways, including:

1. Machine learning: This is a method of teaching computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed.

2. Natural language processing: This involves teaching computers to understand human language and respond in a way that is natural for humans.

3. Robotics: This involves the use of robots to carry out tasks that would otherwise be difficult or impossible for humans to do.

4. Predictive analytics: This is a method of using artificial intelligence to make predictions about future events, trends, and behaviours.

SendPulse Autoresponders


There are many different types of autoresponders, but at SendPulse, we believe that the best autoresponders are the ones that are automated and triggered by specific events.

An automated autoresponder is one that is set up before it is needed and will send messages automatically when a specific event occurs. For example, you could set up an automated autoresponder to send a message to your subscribers when you post a new blog post.

A triggered autoresponder, on the other hand, is one that is set up after it is needed. Triggered autoresponders are activated by some type of user interaction, such as clicking on a link or opening an email.

At SendPulse, we offer both types of autoresponders, and we believe that they are both essential for any successful email marketing campaign.


SendPulse Subscription Forms


A subscription form is a web form used to collect information from website visitors interested in subscribing to a mailing list or newsletter. A subscription form is usually placed on a website's home page or blog, and allows visitors to provide their name and email address in order to subscribe.

There are many different types of subscription forms, and each form can be customized to fit the specific needs of the website. Some common features of subscription forms include the ability to select the type of content the visitor wants to receive, the ability to choose how often they want to receive content, and the ability to unsubscribe from the mailing list at any time.

When creating a subscription form, it is important to make sure the form is easy to use and understand. The form should be simple to fill out, and should only ask for the information necessary to subscribe to the mailing list. It is also important to make sure the form looks professional and is properly aligned on the page.
