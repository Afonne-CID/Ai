How SendPulse 'Unsubscribe' feature allows your campaigns get to peoples inbox
es

As any email marketer knows, the unsubscribe feature is key to keeping your campaigns out of the spam folder and in front of your subscribers. And SendPulse makes it easy to unsubscribe from your campaigns with just a few clicks.

When a subscriber clicks the unsubscribe link in your email, they're taken to a page where they can unsubscribe from all of your campaigns or just specific ones. They can also choose to receive less or more email from you in the future.

This handy unsubscribe feature ensures that your campaigns get to your subscribers' inboxes and not the spam folder. And it's just one of the ways that SendPulse makes email marketing easy and effective.
