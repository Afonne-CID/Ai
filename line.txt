Images, infographics, podcasts (audios), and videos are one of the most important ingredients you cannot afford not to have within your content in the 2020s. Posts that will bring more context and ultimately end the search journey of a user on your page will need to include all the different aspects that humans use to learn the easiest— reading, auditory, and visuals. Some people prefer to watch videos, others will rather read or listen to an audio recording. All these combined give that richness to your content that makes humans and search engines rally around it.


According to Cisco, by 2021, videos will account for 82 percent of all internet traffic. And that’s no surprise, as videos are a great way to show off your products and services, explain difficult concepts, and humanize your brand. Additionally, they can increase dwell time on your page, keep people engaged, and help you rank higher in search engine results pages.

But it’s not just about slapping a video on your page and calling it a day. You need to make sure your videos are high quality, engaging, and helpful to users. Here are a few tips for creating videos that will wow your audience:

1. Start with a strong headline.

Just like with any other piece of content, you need to start with a strong headline that will entice users to watch your video. Make sure it’s catchy and relevant to what the video is about.

2. Keep your videos short and sweet.

Most people won’t want to watch a long video, so keep your videos short and to the point. If you can explain your topic in under two minutes, you’re on the right track.

3. Use visuals to explain complex concepts.

If you’re trying to explain a complex concept, use visuals to help break it down for users. This will help them understand and remember what you’re saying.

4. Use humor.

Humor is a great way to keep people engaged and entertained. Just make sure that the humor you use is appropriate for your brand and audience.

5. Use CTAs to encourage users to take action.

Make sure you include clear CTAs in your videos to encourage users to take action. This could be anything from visiting your website to subscribing to your YouTube channel.

6. Brand your videos.

Make sure your videos are branded with your logo and colors. This will help users associate your videos with your brand.

7. Use keywords in your titles and descriptions.

Make sure you include keywords in your titles and descriptions to help your videos rank higher in search engine results pages.

8. Optimize your videos for SEO.

In order to get the most out of your videos, you need to optimize them for SEO. This includes using the right keywords, titles, and descriptions, as well as adding Closed Captions.
