SendPulse Cons


The main downside to SendPulse is that you cannot currently send out email campaigns to a list of subscribers. You can only send broadcasts to individuals.

This can be a bit of a limitation for some users, but it is worth noting that SendPulse is working on adding this feature in the near future.

Additionally, there is no A/B testing feature as of yet, so you cannot test different versions of your email campaigns to see which ones perform better.

Finally, the pricing structure can be a bit confusing for first time users. It is not immediately clear how much you will have to pay for the different features.
