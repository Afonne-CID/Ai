What Is Vibrant Media's RPM?


RPM, or Revenue Per Mille, is a metric used by online publishers to measure the effectiveness of their advertising. RPM is calculated by dividing ad revenue by the number of pageviews, and multiplying by 1,000. This metric gives a measure of how much money is generated per 1,000 views of an ad.

Vibrant Media's RPM is one of the highest in the industry, and is a testament to the quality and effectiveness of our ad products. Our high RPM helps our clients achieve their desired return on investment, and allows us to continue providing our world-class service.
